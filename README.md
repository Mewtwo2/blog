<h1>Blog</h1>

<p>This is a blog I made that is centered around web development though I might make
other types of posts occasionally. I am currently developing new features for this blog such as
user accounts, email subscriptions in order to be notified of new posts and maybe
Stripe Checkout for donations. I will only implement these features however if they add significant
value to the blog and/or the users of the blog.</p>

&#9673;&emsp;Technologies: Ruby on Rails, Tinymce, SASS, Heroku, Amazon S3<br>
&#9673;&emsp;Unfinished and/or possible implementations: Stripe Checkout, Sidekiq, Redis, Resque Mailer<br>
&#9673;&emsp;Rails version: 5.2.1
